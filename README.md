I have built and deployed a multiplayer pong game using technologies like nodejs, express js ,Socket.IO is a JavaScript library used to enable real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers — perfect for chat apps, live notifications, multiplayer games, etc.  and frontend using html,css and javascript .

Use canvas.js->It is a web-standard JavaScript API used to draw 2D graphics like shapes, text, images, animations, and charts directly in the browser using JavaScript.
There are 2 versions for this application version1 is a singleplayer game which is deployed on netlify and version 2 is multiplayer game which deployed on render

Built on WebSockets, with fallback to HTTP long polling.
Event-based: Uses .emit() and .on() for messaging.
Enables two-way, low-latency communication.
Supports rooms and namespaces for group handling.
Auto-reconnects if connection drops.

Netlify is a platform used for deploying and hosting static websites and modern web apps with continuous integration from Git.
Render, a cloud hosting service used for deploying full-stack web applications with seamless backend, frontend, and database integration.
It’s fully deployed on Render, making it accessible anytime. Overall, this project highlights my skills in building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications, and reflects my interest in this domain.
